This system is designed to register cars and trucks and their owners. It allows the user to add, update, and delete car and truck records.
 The system also provides the functionality to search for a car or truck by its registration number and display all registered cars and/or trucks.

 The Car Registration System allows users to register cars and trucks by implementing the following functionalities:
Add Car: Allows users to add a new car to the system by entering the registration number, make, model, and owner details.

Update Car: Allows users to update the details of an existing car by entering the registration number and the new make, model, and owner details.

Delete Car: Allows users to delete a car from the system by entering the registration number.

Search Car: Allows users to search for a car by entering the registration number and displays the car details if found.

Display All Cars: Displays the details of all registered cars in the system.

Add Truck: Allows users to add a new truck to the system by entering the registration number, make, model, owner, and capacity details.

Update Truck: Allows users to update the details of an existing truck by entering the registration number and the new make, model, owner, and capacity details.

Delete Truck: Allows users to delete a truck from the system by entering the registration number.

Search Truck: Allows users to search for a truck by entering the registration number and displays the truck details if found.

Display All Trucks: Displays the details of all registered trucks in the system.

The program uses object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to implement the Car Registration System. The Car and Truck classes inherit from the Vehicle class, which contains common attributes and methods shared by cars and trucks. The CarRegistrationSystem and TruckRegistrationSystem classes inherit from the CarRegistrationSystem class to reuse the common functionality for registering cars and trucks.
The program also demonstrates the use of getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes, such as the registration number of a car. This provides better control over the data and prevents direct access to the private attributes from outside the class.
Overall, the Car Registration System is a simple yet effective program that showcases the use of object-oriented programming concepts to implement a real-world application. It can be further extended to include additional features and functionalities based on specific requirements.
The program can be improved by adding input validation to ensure that the user enters valid data for each field. This can help prevent errors and improve the overall user experience. Additionally, error handling can be implemented to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the user in case of any issues.    
The program can also be enhanced by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. This can include buttons, input fields, and other interactive elements to make it easier for users to register cars and trucks.    
Overall, the Car Registration System is a versatile program that can be customized and extended to meet various requirements. It provides a solid foundation for managing car and truck registrations and can be further developed to include additional features and functionalities as needed.
